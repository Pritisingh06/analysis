# COVID-19 Data Analysis  

This project conducts an analysis of COVID-19 data to investigate patterns related to death rates, age, and gender differences among patients. Using R programming and data manipulation libraries, my aim to derive insights from the dataset and visualize the results effectively.  

## Project Structure  

- `COVID19.csv`: The raw dataset used for analysis.  
- `COVID19_analysis.R`: The main R script containing the analysis code.  
- `README.md`: This documentation file.  

## Data Description  

The dataset contains information related to COVID-19 cases, including demographics such as age, gender, and death status. It is assumed that the dataset has the following key columns:  

- `age`: Age of the individual.  
- `gender`: Gender of the individual (e.g., "male", "female").  
- `death`: Indicates whether the individual died from COVID-19 (non-zero indicates death).  

## Analysis Overview  

### 1. Death Rate Calculation  

The overall death rate is calculated based on the dataset to determine the percentage of individuals who have died from COVID-19.  

### 2. Age Analysis  

We analyze the mean age of deceased versus alive individuals to understand how age might influence mortality.  

### 3. Gender Analysis  

- The death rates for male and female individuals are calculated and compared.  
- A t-test is performed to statistically compare the death status between genders.  

### 4. Visualization  

A bar plot is created to visualize and compare the death rates by gender, providing a clear graphical representation of the findings.  

## Required Libraries  

The following R libraries are required to run the analysis:  

- `Hmisc`: For data manipulation and statistical analysis.  
  
To install any missing libraries, run:  
```R  
install.packages("Hmisc")
